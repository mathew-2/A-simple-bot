# A-simple-bot
This is a simple bot that uses LLM models and a simple frontend to take user input and give results

If anyone wants to make their own bot through this code just take the code from the lambda python file and put it in your own lambda function in your own aws account

while you can use the same code for the frontend streamlit website
